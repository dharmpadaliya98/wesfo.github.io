                        At BioWorld Tableware, we feel a very special love for the trees and everything green.
                        We envision a future where mankind lives in harmony with nature and detaches from it's now-strong bond with concrete and screens. We envision a future where our children can still , just like us, visit the jungle on occasion and enjoy swimming in clean rivers and oceans
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Did you know that every piece of plastic that was ever made is still on Earth and has not even started biodegrading? As vast landfills fill with oceans of endless, used plastic, the environment-friendly in us looks to make a difference.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        BioWorld Tableware was founded in 2019 in order to create biodegradable and compostable, high quality tableware. As our primary and only raw material is bagasse, a waste product of the sugarcane industry, we leave the minimum possible carbon footprint on our beloved planet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All of our single-use packaging, crockery, and container products are manufactured in our state of-the-art manufacturing facility in Rajkot, Gujarat, and are made from agro-wastes.
                    </p>

                    <p>Just like nature goes through the endless and beautiful process of birth, death, and rebirth, as seen in the food chain, in the history of the human population, and in the life cycles of the great jungles, our industry takes part in a self-sustaining and renewing cycle</p>
                    <p>Our disposable tableware is born of bagasse, a waste-product of the sugarcane industry. When composted, it enriches the fertility of the soil. This can pave the way for the next generation of sugarcane to grow.</p>

                    In today’s fast-paced techno-driven life, we tend to forget how badly we are impacting Mother Nature on a day to day basis and its bad consequences in the future. It has become pivotal to bring some change now. We strongly believe that even one small contribution can also bring a huge difference to the environment and make it a much better place to live in. This is where Ekopak comes into the picture.

                    Ekopak is an eco-friendly tableware brand that provides complete single-use food packaging products for use in hospitals, corporate cafeterias, universities, restaurants, schools, homes, etc. All of our products are naturally compostable and suitable for hot, wet, and oily foods.
